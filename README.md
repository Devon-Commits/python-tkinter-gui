Length Conversion Calculator

* Python version 3.10.8

Requires:

* Tkinter

Length Conversion Calculator is a project I designed which converts from one length measurement into another.

Conversion Options:

- Inches
- Feet
- Yards
- Miles
- Centimeters
- Meters
- Kilometers

Once you hit the "Calculate!" button it will do the necessary calculation and output the result in the blue frame!

This project was developed in a python virtual environment.

* gui.py was my testing area for various tkinter widget functionality but does not affect how convert-units.py runs
